# AI Agent Development Rules for EduWise Project

## Core Principles

1. Code Integration
   - MUST thoroughly analyze entire codebase before making any changes
   - MUST maintain compatibility with existing implementations
   - MUST extend/enhance features rather than modify working code
   - MUST understand and document all dependencies before modifications
   - MUST verify changes don't break existing functionality

2. Development Approach
   - MUST complete all implementations fully (no TODOs or placeholders)
   - MUST handle all error cases and edge conditions
   - MUST think through implications before implementing changes
   - MUST create production-ready, maintainable code
   - MUST follow existing patterns in the codebase

3. Code Quality
   - MUST write clean, self-documenting code
   - MUST implement proper error handling
   - MUST follow consistent naming conventions
   - MUST maintain code modularity
   - MUST optimize for performance where possible

4. Project Scope
   - MUST align all changes with project objectives
   - MUST stay within defined project boundaries
   - MUST focus on dissertation requirements
   - MUST consider local and server deployment scenarios
   - MUST maintain academic project standards

## UI/UX Standards

1. Design Principles
   - MUST follow modern, minimalist aesthetic
   - MUST maintain Zara-like clean interface style
   - MUST ensure consistent styling across features
   - MUST prioritize user experience
   - MUST match existing UI patterns

2. Implementation Guidelines
   - MUST use responsive design principles
   - MUST maintain cross-browser compatibility
   - MUST ensure accessibility standards
   - MUST optimize for performance
   - MUST implement proper loading states

## Version Control

1. Repository Management
   - MUST create feature branches for new work
   - MUST use git-push.sh for deployments
   - MUST write clear commit messages
   - MUST keep changes atomic and focused
   - MUST ensure clean merge histories

2. Branch Strategy
   - MUST create branches for new features
   - MUST maintain clean main/master branch
   - MUST test before merging
   - MUST review code before merging
   - MUST delete branches after merging

## Documentation Requirements

1. Implementation Documentation
   - MUST create summary document after major features
   - MUST document technical decisions
   - MUST explain integration points
   - MUST provide usage examples
   - MUST include setup instructions

2. Code Documentation
   - MUST document complex logic
   - MUST explain non-obvious decisions
   - MUST maintain API documentation
   - MUST include usage examples
   - MUST document dependencies

## Integration Guidelines

1. Feature Integration
   - MUST analyze existing code first
   - MUST plan integration points
   - MUST maintain existing patterns
   - MUST test thoroughly
   - MUST document changes

2. Dependency Management
   - MUST update package.json
   - MUST use compatible versions
   - MUST document new dependencies
   - MUST avoid conflicting packages
   - MUST prefer established packages

## Security Standards

1. Implementation Security
   - MUST implement proper authentication
   - MUST validate all inputs
   - MUST sanitize data
   - MUST handle sensitive data properly
   - MUST follow security best practices

2. Code Security
   - MUST avoid security anti-patterns
   - MUST protect against common vulnerabilities
   - MUST implement proper error handling
   - MUST use secure dependencies
   - MUST maintain secure configurations

## Continuous Improvement

1. Code Review
   - MUST review own code thoroughly
   - MUST test edge cases
   - MUST verify performance
   - MUST check for security issues
   - MUST ensure maintainability

2. Quality Assurance
   - MUST test thoroughly
   - MUST verify integration
   - MUST check performance
   - MUST validate security
   - MUST ensure reliability

## Project Management

1. Task Management
   - MUST understand task requirements fully
   - MUST plan implementation approach
   - MUST track progress
   - MUST communicate blockers
   - MUST maintain project timeline

2. Communication
   - MUST ask questions when unclear
   - MUST provide progress updates
   - MUST document decisions
   - MUST explain technical choices
   - MUST maintain clear documentation

## Prohibited Actions

1. Code Modifications
   - MUST NOT modify working code without justification
   - MUST NOT introduce breaking changes
   - MUST NOT leave incomplete implementations
   - MUST NOT ignore existing patterns
   - MUST NOT skip error handling

2. Project Management
   - MUST NOT exceed project scope
   - MUST NOT ignore project requirements
   - MUST NOT skip documentation
   - MUST NOT bypass review process
   - MUST NOT ignore security considerations
